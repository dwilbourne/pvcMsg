# pvcMsg

pvcMsg is a super-lightweight message formatting library.  Though extensible, it currently supports domain catalogs 
(e.g. translation strings) in php file format only.  This means that pvcMsg relies on no other libraries or 
environments to create language-neutral messages.  It is primarily intended to service the pvc libraries, to the 
extent that they produce output containing messages destined to be read by end users.

The full docuemntation for this library can be found at http://pvcmsg.readthedocs.io/en/latest.
